# illusDragon NRS

illusDragon NRS is a program that allows users to draw polygons and polylines. There are some
other features such as editing, adding, and deleting vertices, also coloring the polygons, as well
as clearing the screen/canvas. We are using VB .NET as our programming language to create
this application. The canvas is built using a built-in system, bitmap, means every
object created in this program is defined by pixels. The screen coordinates origin is started on
the upper-left corner of the window.

This program is implemented using a linked list as the data structure. The
implementation using a linked list means that we are storing items in the form of nodes into the
list. The advantages of using linked lists over arrays here are the objects are easier to allocate
and be accessed with the pointer, also there is no need to assign or determine the size of the
medium.

We also provide several test case inside test.txt to load and continue drawing.

This program created to fulfill first programming assignment in Computer Graphics and Animation course in President University.
